# Portfolio

This repo is to display screenshots/videos of projects that I was the main/sole developer on. Most of these projects were for private companies, so I could not share the entire repo, but here's the next best thing to show off my skills.

## GoLoCo (2016-2017)
GoLoCo was a digital entertainment company that curates live music recommendations in your area based on your Spotify playlists. It integrated with the Spotify API and MapBox to access user playlist data and display nearby shows on the in-app map. The user could find shows through the map or the calendar screen, and purchase the tickets directly through the app. They could then listen to any suggested artist in the app through the Spotify API playback feature. There was also a friends and geo-located social feed aspect that allowed you to be a part of your local scene by setting your desired map radius. We pulled show data from Ticketmaster and our own managed database.

I led a team of 4 developers (3 on/off backend devs + me on iOS) from the ideation stage to successful launch of our iOS app on the App Store.

## Stock Champ (2017-2019)
Stock Champ was my own creation that I brought to life with the help of 2 finance buddies and a hired backend dev. It was a fantasy sports spin on the stock market, where players compete against others for a chance to win money based on their knowledge of the market. Imagine DraftKings + Ameritrade. Users could enter daily/weekly contests to select their lineup of stocks to compete for the cash prizes. The entries were scored based on the cumulative percent change of the selected stocks. All stock data was fetched in real time using the IEX Exchange API. There was also a research tab for users to keep up with the latest market news and see the top trending stocks.

I led a team of 4 through the ideation, strategy, and development stages of the business. I worked closely with our employed developer to create the iOS application with Swift frontend and node.js backend, hosted on AWS. We reached the Beta Testing phase, having 50+ participants download the app through TestFlight and play in daily/weekly contests with payouts.

## CoyneReinkeLaw (2021-2022)
Coyne Reinke Law is my uncle's law firm. He paid me to make him a more modern website for his practice. I modified a bootstrap template with the content from his old site, which I had also created years before on GoDaddy. The site is HTML, CSS, Javascript, with a little PHP to allow the visitors to send him an email from the Contact Us section. My biggest addition to the template was the modal view popup descriptions that display more information about the team members and the notable cases. Instead of screenshots, you can just view the website here [https://www.coynereinkelaw.com](https://www.coynereinkelaw.com)

I also managed all the DNS settings, transferring them from the GoDaddy managed namespaces and records to AWS Route 53 namespaces and custom DNS records. I deployed the site through Elastic Beanstalk, hosted on EC2, also utilizing the Amazon Simple Email Service. 

## HomeBase (2022)
HomeBase is a practice project that I made to work on my new React.js and Node.js skills, as well as brush back up on my Swift and iOS development skills. It was inspired by my time bartending this past year and the scheduling system we used for our shifts. It allows employees to clock in/out for work, and see the tip-out amounts for each day, their income history, and their profile info.

<br />
The entire project is comprised of a React web app, Node backend, MySQL database, and iOS application. The iOS app screenshots are shown here, but I greatly encourage you to check out its own repo for more details and code: [https://github.com/cturczynski/HomeBase-ios](https://github.com/cturczynski/HomeBase-ios)
